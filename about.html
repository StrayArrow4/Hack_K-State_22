            <h2> Inspiration</h2>
            <p>wanted to create something familiar to lots but also completely new to us </p>
            <h2> What it does</h2>
            <p>pass and play connect 4 with a futuristic glitch-pop theme </p>
            <h2> How we built it</h2>
            <p>using javascript we created the functionality of the classic connect 4 game with HTML and CSS we gave the boring Connect 4 game a bright and relaxed theme.</p>
            <h2> Challenges we ran into</h2>
            <p>1. had some trouble finding a winning play as well as receiving win screens when no one would have a winning play.</p>
            <p>2. learning that javascript did not accept 64-bit integers so we ended up learning how to use a new library to convert the 34-bit integers to 64 bit</p>
            <p>3. some of our styles would not work as intended</p>
            
            <h2> Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
            <p>1. Creating a fully-fledged working app.</p>
            <p>2. making a good-looking app </p>
            
            <h2> What we learned</h2>
           
            <p>1. learned how to use bit bords
            <p>2. learned how to represent numbers as 64 bit integers</p>
            <p>3. learned how to host a website through gethub pages</p>
            <p>4. learned how to set up a PWA</p>
            <p>5. learned about CSS animations</p>
            
            <h2> What's next for Connect 2077</h2>
            <p>like our style inspiration from cyberpunk 2077, we will have post-launch patch fixes. Adding an Ai to play against would be a nice improvement.</p>
